# Module5-Challenge
In this repo I'll be creating a daily planner website for the Module 5 challenge
# Sources
starter code pulled from: [https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/crispy-octo-meme](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/crispy-octo-meme)
# Goals
#### WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
#### WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
#### WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
#### WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
#### WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
#### WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
